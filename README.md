# KitaevLadder
Using TeNPy to simulate Kitaev Ladders. This will be part of my PSI essay work.

## Notice for the PSI work
To check with those mentioned in my PSI essay, please open and read the `Demo for the Essay.ipynb`.

## Using TeNPy
TeNPy has already implemented the lattice structure for ladders.

## Reference
 - The code design is based on the [Haldane model](https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy/blob/master/examples/chern_insulators/haldane_C3.py) given in the TeNPy example.
 - Relevant papers includes: [Yang, 2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.5792.pdf)
