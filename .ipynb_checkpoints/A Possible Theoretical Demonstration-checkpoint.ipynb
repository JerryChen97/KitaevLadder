    "According to some analytic paper, in the Kitaev ladder, the local operator `d`'s should be all good quantum numbers and also commute with each other, and therefore they are acting like some kind of gauge symmetry; furthermore, it is totally fine to randomly fix the gauage and make use of a single gauge fixing to derive a global phase diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is not straight forward that local gauge symmetry has to be randomly fixable. If two operators `A` and `B` are commutable with each other, the only conclusion we can get is that the eigenstates `v` of `A` in the same eigenvalues `k` will remain the same eigenvalues after acted by `B`, i.e. `Av = kv => ABv = BAv = Bkv = kBv = k(Bv)`. Generally, we can only see that commutable operator will not transform the eigenstates out side of its previous energy sector; in particular, a ground state will not be excited by a commutable operator, but we are never sure whether or not it is also an eigenstate of this operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the random choice of gauge fixing implies that for a Kitaev ladder of length `L` (we define the width of a Kitaev ladder to be `2`), there will be `2^L` ground states. We can reasonably guess that this is again based on the assumption that each ground state must be the eigenstate of each local operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of gauge fixing shows discrepencies with our iDMRG simulation results, and two papers choosing two different fixing present discrepencies with each other. On this observation, we can cautiously believe that, their random gauge fixing choices are not so proper as they guessed; at least, their gauge fixing cannot be applied to the global phase diagram of Kitaev ladders.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to demonstrate that they are kind of wrong is difficult: after JW transformation and Majorana transformation, the Hamiltonian has changed a lot and is no longer the same as before. This causes problems when we want to decide how to design the explicit matrix formula. To escape from such difficulty, we can consider count the degeneracy of ground states, i.e. the dimension of the ground state space."
